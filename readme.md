# AskAli - Your Personal AI Chatbot ü§ñ

Welcome to **AskAli**, a chatbot designed to showcase **Ali's professional journey** in a friendly and conversational way. Built using the **Google Gemini API**, this AI chatbot provides an interactive and engaging way for **HR professionals**, **Talent Acquisition teams**, and **developers** to learn about my skills, expertise, and achievements. The chatbot is designed to replace the traditional, formal resume by answering questions and providing insights in a more human-like and casual manner.

## üöÄ Features

**AskAli** has been created to help recruiters, HR professionals, and fellow developers get to know me better‚Äîthrough an interactive conversation that goes beyond the standard resume format. Here are some of its features:

- **HR & Recruiter-Friendly**: HR professionals and recruiters can use **AskAli** to explore my background, tech stack, and accomplishments in a more engaging way.
  
- **Developer-Focused**: For fellow developers, the bot highlights the technologies I work with, including backend languages, frameworks, databases, and my involvement in open-source projects.

- **AI-Powered Conversations**: The chatbot leverages the **Google Gemini API**, which allows it to generate accurate, context-aware responses, making it feel like a personal interaction rather than a static response.

- **Scalable & Interactive**: It's not just a simple FAQ bot‚Äî**AskAli** allows for nuanced conversations about my background, areas of expertise, and projects in an interactive and engaging way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Building **AskAli** was an exciting journey, and here's the technology stack I used to bring it to life:

- **Google Gemini API**: The core of the chatbot's conversational abilities. It generates dynamic and context-aware responses based on the profile context I provide, allowing the chatbot to give accurate answers to questions about my experience, skills, and projects.

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to serve the chatbot on the web. It allows me to build a simple but scalable API that interacts with the Google Gemini API and serves responses to users.

- **Python**: The main programming language behind the chatbot. Python is used for backend logic, including calling the Google Gemini API, handling responses, and structuring data.

- **JSON**: Used to format the requests and responses between the Flask server and the Google Gemini API. It's a lightweight and efficient format to handle data exchanges.

- **Heroku (Optional)**: To deploy the chatbot, I used **Heroku**, a cloud platform that allows you to deploy web applications quickly and easily. Heroku is great for hosting lightweight applications like this one for free.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

If you'd like to run **AskAli** locally and interact with the chatbot, follow these steps to set up the project:

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AskAli.git
cd AskAli
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies

Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system. If you don‚Äôt have it, install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Then, install the required dependencies using **pip** (Python's package manager):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your Google Gemini API Key

To interact with **Google Gemini**, you will need an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the **Google Gemini API** documentation and sign up for access (if you haven‚Äôt already).
2. Create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Gemini API.
3. Generate the API key for your project.

Once you have the key, store it as an environment variable. You can do this by running:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
```

Alternatively, you can directly include it in your code (though it‚Äôs recommended to keep it secure by not hardcoding sensitive info).

### 4. Run the Flask app

Now, you‚Äôre ready to start the chatbot! Run the Flask app with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once it's running, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to start interacting with **AskAli**.

## üíª How It Works

The **AskAli** chatbot is powered by the **Google Gemini API** and is built to generate intelligent, human-like responses based on a detailed profile of me. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Profile Context**: The bot is fed with a comprehensive **profile context** that includes details about my professional experience, skills, achievements, and tech stack.
   
2. **Google Gemini API**: The chatbot uses the **Google Gemini API** to process questions and generate context-aware responses. For example, if you ask about the languages I‚Äôve worked with, it‚Äôll pull the relevant information from my profile and generate a response like: "I‚Äôve worked with PHP, Python, JavaScript, C, and C++."
   
3. **Casual Conversation**: The chatbot is designed to have a conversational tone, making it more interactive and engaging than a traditional resume.

4. **No Static Responses**: Unlike a static webpage, the chatbot can respond dynamically to different queries, keeping the conversation going naturally.

## üéØ Goal

The primary goal of **AskAli** is to provide an engaging and personal way for HR professionals, recruiters, and developers to learn about my skills, expertise, and professional background. 

**HR and Recruiters**: 
- Learn about my skills, expertise, and experience in a conversational manner.
- Get detailed insights into the technologies I use, my approach to backend engineering, AI, and more.

**Developers**:
- Ask about the tech stack I‚Äôve worked with and get insights into how I‚Äôve built different systems and automated processes.

The chatbot is a tool to provide **non-traditional, casual answers** that go beyond the format of a standard resume or LinkedIn profile.

## üìù Example Interaction

Here‚Äôs an example of a conversation you might have with **AskAli**:

**User**: "What languages have you worked with?"

**AskAli**: "I‚Äôve worked with **PHP**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C**, and **C++**, helping me build robust backend systems. I always keep myself open to learning new languages as I grow in my career!"

You can also deploy **AskAli** to the cloud and make it accessible to anyone. Here's how you can deploy it to **Heroku** (or similar platforms):

1. Push your project to a GitHub repository.
2. Create a new app on **Heroku** and link it to your GitHub repository.
3. Set up your **Google Gemini API key** as an environment variable on Heroku.
